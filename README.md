# Slippi Stats Application
This repository contains three submodules that link to the three components of this application

1. Slippi Overlay - the electron application that handles file management and window tracking
2. SlippiStatsBackend - the graphql/postgreSQL backend for my website
3. SlippiStatsWebsite - all of the front end code that handles the UI of the app using React/next.js

This application is still a work in progress so things that look incomplete are just placeholders that will be fixed in time.
